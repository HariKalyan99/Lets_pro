**How does it work?**

**When you’re building an application, three principles are to be followed**.

- From the customer’s point of view, the application shouldn’t be complicated, it should be pleasing and it should address most of their problems.
- From a business aspect, your web application should stay aligned with its product/market fit.
- From an engineer’s perspective, the application should be scalable, functional, and it should be able to bear high traffic loads.

# What is Web Application Architecture?



*Do you know that there is a difference between websites and web applications? ( you might have thought that both are the same). The web application is a program that runs on a browser and it has mainly three formal characteristics.*

![do you know](https://www.targeticon.com/static/media/web-app-development.7dcba28e5dee4bf603bc.gif)

1. Addresses a particular problem, even if it’s simply finding some information
2. As interactive as a desktop application
3. Works with Content Management System.

If we talk about the website then traditionally it’s just a combination of static pages. A website becomes a web application when it consists of both static and dynamic pages (yes!! it’s true that all modern websites are the example of web applications.) 

- Web application architecture is a mechanism that gives us a clarification that how the connection is established between the client and the server. It determines how the components in an application communicate with each other. It doesn’t matter what is the size and the complexity level of the application is, they all follow the same principle only the details may differ. 

![mechanism](https://bootestech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/intiate-ecommerce-website-brand.gif)

In technical terms, when a user makes a request on a website, various components of the applications, user interfaces, middleware systems, databases, servers, and the browser interact with each other. Web Application Architecture is a framework that ties up this relation together and maintains the interaction between these components. 

![web arch in detail!](https://asperbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Web-App-Architecture-1.png)

- When a user interacts with a website and gets the response back from the server’s end, the whole process executes within a few seconds.  The most important thing we need to notice here is the code which has been passed to the browser. This code may or may not have particular instructions telling the browser how to respond with respect to the different types of user inputs. That’s why a web application architecture includes all the sub-components and external applications interchanges for an entire software application. A web application architecture has to deal with the reliability, scalability, security, and robustness due to a large amount of global network traffic. 


# How Does The Web Request Work?

# *Suppose: Netflix*

- You enter Netflix.com in your browser
- The web server processes the request
- You get the response back

# *How Netflix is determined, if you are curious?*

# Typically this is how it looks from an engineer's point of view!

**All the web applications run on the client-side and the server-side. When a user makes a request there are mainly two programs run on both sides.**

- Code that runs in the browser and works as per the inputs of the user.
- Code in the server which responds to the HTTP requests

# Web Application Three Tier Architecture Layers

![layer](https://vfunction.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/blog-3-tier-application.webp)

**Presentation Layer**: 
- This layer is accessible to the client via a browser and it includes user interface components and UI process components. As we have already discussed that these UI components are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and its frameworks or library) where each of them plays a different role in building the user interface.

**Business Layer**: 
It is also referred to as a Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer. It accepts the user’s request from the browser, processes it, and regulates the routes through which the data will be accessed. The whole workflow is encoded in this layer. You can take the example of booking a hotel on a website. A traveler will go through a sequence of events to book the hotel room and the whole workflow will be taken care of by the business logic.

**Persistence Layer**: 
- It is also referred to as a storage or data access layer. This layer collects all the data calls and provides access to the persistent storage of an application. The business layer is closely attached to the persistence layer, so the logic knows which database to talk to and the process of retrieving data becomes more optimized. A server and a database management system software exist in data storage infrastructure which is used to communicate with the database itself, applications, and user interfaces to retrieve data and parse it. You can store the data in hardware servers or in the cloud.


# *Types of Web Application Architecture*

- Single Page Applications
- Microservices
- Serverless Architectures

Web architecture encompasses a variety of components, each with its role in delivering a seamless user experience. The architecture can vary depending on the complexity of the application and the specific needs of the project (e.g., monolithic vs. microservices). The main components include the frontend, backend, database, and networking layers, along with additional features like caching, load balancing, and security mechanisms.

Hope this was helpful in understanding the complete architecture of web applications. The web apps are continuously evolving and a lot of modern web development app has replaced the previous legacy structure and basic components. A lot of features of web applications such as robustness, security, scalability, reliability, responsiveness depends on the web application architecture one chooses to work with. The right web application architecture paves the way for future plans of expansion and scalability. So it’s always good to explore the requirements and goals before someone gets started with the development process of an application.
